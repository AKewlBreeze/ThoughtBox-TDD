## ThoughtBox

### Install

First things first => `npm install`

To run your server => `npm start`

To run your test suite => `npm test`

This application was built with `create-react-app`

### Goals

The application is similar to IdeaBox, just more original.. So the goal of this project is to TDD a react application.

We will be using Jest and Enyzme to test each component. Start off with the `CreateThought.test.js`
First just try and get the first test to pass.

Then move forward to testing and building:

* `thoughtList.test.js`
* `thoughtCard.test.js`

Finally test App! By now your App component is most likely fully built. This is a great opportunity to fully test integration of your application.

Extension:

If you've gotten this far, congrats you rule!! But wait, theres more. Now build out a delete functionality. Start by putting a delete button inside your `ThoughtCard` component. Good Luck!
